# Change log
## 0.2.0
Renamed the `k` function used in JSON Template to `K` to let users use variable name `k` (a common name for a key in a JSON object). This name also matches the JSON Template from System Template Regolith filter.

## 0.1.2
Added support for glob patterns in the map file.

## 0.1.1
Fixed a bug where having multiple script entry points for Esbuild would crash the filter.

## 0.1.0
Initial release.
